## Usage

First, if you don't have the dependencies installed on your computer, run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sender (Remote)

You will be able to send a webhook request remotely running the `webhook_remote.py` file by using `python webhook_remote.py`.

_Note: You can update the webhook online url on the `webhook_remote.py` file by creating your own for free on the [Webhook site](https://webhook.site/)._

#### Demo Sender (Remote)

```shell
‚ûú python webhook_remote.py
Success
```

### Receiver

You will be able to run the server by using `python server.py`.

#### Demo Receiver

```shell
‚ûú  python server.py
 * Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Accessing the `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` on your navigator, you'll see somthing like this:

### Sender (Local)

You will be able to send a webhook request locally to the server above running the `webhook_local.py` file by using `python webhook_local.py` (on another terminal than the one where the `server.py` script is running).

#### Demo Sender (Local)

```shell
‚ûú python webhook_local.py
Success
```

If you do so, the terminal with the server.py script running will return the JSON he received:

```shell
‚ûú  python server.py
 * Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
