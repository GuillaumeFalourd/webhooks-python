## Usage

First, if you don't have the dependencies installed on your computer, run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you will be able to run the `webhook.py` file by using `python webhook.py`.

_Note: You can update the webhook online url on the `webhook.py` file by creating your own for free on the [Webhook site](https://webhook.site/)._

## Demo

**Sending requests:**

```shell
➜ python3 webhook.py
Success
```
